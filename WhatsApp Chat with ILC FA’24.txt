امید ہے آپ سب خیر و آفیت سے ہوں گے
بندہ ناچیز کا اسم طہ ہے۔ انگریزی میں بولے تو...taha
یوں تو میں لاہور کا باشندہ ہوں مگر پہاڑ اچھے لگتے تھے تو اسلامآباد آگیا (وہ بات الگ ہے کہ ابھی تک کچھ خاص تفریحی مقامات پر گیا نہیں کچھ اساتذہ نے قسم کھائی ہوئی ہے کہ انہیں مستیاں نہیں کرنے دیں گے)
یہاں کامسیٹس میں سافٹ ویئر انجینئرنگ کر رہا ہوں۔ فی الوقت تیسرے سمیسٹر سے دو چار (4 2) ہو رہا ہوں. 🤒

مجھے شاعری اور فلسفے کا شوق ہے خیر. یوں ہوتا ہے نا جیسے کچھ الفاظ دل کو بھا جاتے ہیں ٹھیک ویسے ہی۔ البتہ مجھے کبھی سمجھ نہیں آتی کہ میں میرے پسندیدہ مشغلے کے جواب میں کیا کہوں۔ 
مگر حال ہی میں میں اس نتیجے پر پہنچا ہوں کہ شاید سونے کے علاؤہ اس ظالم سماج میں میرا اور کوئی کام نہیں۔ 
اور یہ کتنا خوبصورت مشغلہ بھی ہے۔ مجھے سمجھ نہیں آتی لوگ یہ کیوں کہتے ہیں کہ زندگی میں مزہ نہیں۔ جب یہ والی زندگی اچھی نہ لگے بس سو جاؤ۔ خوابوں میں مستیاں کرو۔ نہ کوئی پڑھائی کی فکر نہ کیریر کی ٹنشن۔ (نوٹ ٹو منشن مگر میں ایک دفعہ خواب میں سپائڈر مین بھی بنا تھا😭😭😭
اتنا مزہ آیا نا جالا پھینک کے اڑنے میں۔ میں اس اکسپیرئنس کا اظہار الفاظ میں بیاں نہیں کر سکتا✨

خیر تو بس میں یہی کہہ رہا تھا کہ میں کیک کھانے کے لئے بھت آکسائیٹڈ ہوں😍
